                <h2 class="missionstatement">Providing a warm, welcoming space for rescue cats to rest
                    while they wait for their forever homes. Rooted in Asian traditions of hospitality and
                    connection, The Mao Lounge offers a place where both people and cats can feel at peace. Every cup
                    served
                    and
                    every purr shared supports our goal of giving these beloved companions the love and care they
                    deserve.

                <p class="meaning-text">Our founder wanted to integrate both her Chinese heritage and her love for cats
                    into one place, hence
                    the
                    birth of The Mao Lounge. "Mao" means cat in Mandarin, and in our coffee shop, we strive to uphold
                    Asian
                    hospitality principles while saving cats from euthanization.</p>

            <h2 class="inspo">The inspiration</h2>
            <img class="moon" src="images/cat.jpg" alt="cat">
            <p class="most-text">Meet Moon, short for Mooncake (a traditional Chinese dessert eaten during the Lunar
                Festival). Our
                founder was in her 1st year of grad school when she found Moon. Our founder was struggling with
                balancing school work and a corporate job- not to mention her increasing lonliness in a city she was
                unfamiliar with.
                One day, she was walking through her typical route after class. Her shoelaces were untied, and she
                caught the attention of Moon who followed her to the bus stop. Moon seemed to take to our founder
                immediately, and it was clear that Moon had to go home with her.
                Had our founder not taken Moon back with her, Moon would have probably been caught and taken to the
                pound where she would have been put down. With this realization, our founder wanted to create a place
                where cats could safely stay until they found a home to go to.
