                <p class="ourcatdescription">One of our missions at The Mao Lounge is to provide a home to cats that
                    don't
                    have one. This way, we are able to
                    prevent cats from being euthanized, and give them a comfy space to live before they are taken to
                    their forever
                    home. <br> All cats are up for adoption, please ask one of our Cat Managers or email us at
                    TheMaoLounge@gmail.com</p>

                        littermates had
                        been adopted except for him. The couple could not keep him, so they brought him
                        here.

                    <p class="infofont">Tiki is an energetic and mischevious little purrball. He tends to get the
                        zoomies
                        often,
                        and loves to swat at anything dangly so protect your shoelaces!</p>
                    <p class="infofont">But he's also the sweetest cuddlebug and can stay in your arms for hours. He's
                        quite
                        a
                        talkative one so be prepared for a lot of tiny meows from him.</p>

                    <p class="infofont">Sesame is a chill little kitten that gets easily distracted. He loves to waddle
                        around
                        and greet new people. For a 3 month kitten, he is surprisingly social!</p>
                    <p class="infofont">He is a bit squirmy at first, but once he warms up to you, he'll follow you
                        every
                        where.

                    <p class="infofont">One of our Cat Manager's found Cherry on the way to work. According to her, she
                        stepped
                        out of her house, and as she walked down her porch she heard a quiet meow from below
                        the
                        stairs. She took a peek and found Cherry curled up in a ball.

                    <p class="infofont">Our Cherry is a bit of a diva. He never comes up to you, but will sit in his
                        chosen
                        spot
                        and observe you until you come up and make a move. He'll reject your advances at
                        first,
                        but if you feed him, he'll let you pet him for a bit.</p>
                    <p class="infofont">Don't expect him to stay there for long though. For him, enough is enough and
                        he'll
                        hop
                        away. But he is such a sweet boy and will give you the occasional headbutt of
                        affection.</p>
